  1.  This one is for rote memorization.  
      Pretend like you are Bart Simpson in detention and write the sentence,
      or say it out as many times as necessary until it spills out of your brain with no effort:

      “A pointer is a variable that holds the memory address of another variable.”

  2.  Make a list of common data types and the corresponding number of bytes they take up in memory on an Arduino UNO.  
      For example,  integer - 2 bytes, char 1 byte

  3.  Open a new Arduino sketch and declare pointers of each of the types you have in your table above.  
      Remember, when declaring a pointer variable, the * asterisk (aka dereference / indirection operator) 
      is used before the name to let the compiler know this will be a pointer variable.
